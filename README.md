## 📖 About the Project

This project provides a complete set of technical documentation for the Obsidian application. It covers fundamental concepts, step-by-step tasks for common operations, and detailed reference materials. The goal is to create a clear, well-structured, and easy-to-navigate resource that helps users master Obsidian's core features and advanced capabilities.

This documentation was created to fulfill the requirements of a technical writing course, demonstrating skills in content strategy, topic-based authoring, and documentation tools.

## 🎯 Target Audience

This documentation is written for two primary audiences:

1.  **End-Users**: Individuals new to Obsidian who want to learn how to use it for personal knowledge management, note-taking, and organizing their ideas.
2.  **Developers**: Individuals interested in understanding Obsidian's extensibility, such as its plugin architecture, and who may want to build on top of the platform.

## 🚀 How to Access the Documentation

All documentation content is located in the **[Project Wiki](https://github.com/giermarjores/obsidian-documentation)**.

## 🔌 API Documentation

As part of this project, a mock API documentation was created using **Swagger**. This API specification documents two fictional endpoints for a potential Obsidian-like service, demonstrating how to document REST APIs.

-   **Endpoint 1**: `GET /vault/notes/{noteId}` - Retrieve the content of a specific note.
-   **Endpoint 2**: `POST /vault/notes` - Create a new note in the vault.

*(You would typically host your Swagger UI page and link to it here. For a class project, you can include the YAML/JSON file in the repo or link to a public SwaggerHub page.)*

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

-   **Content**: All documentation is written in **Markdown**.
-   **Hosting**: **GitHub Wiki** is used for hosting and organizing the documentation pages.
-   **Version Control**: **Git** and **GitHub** are used for project management.
-   **API Documentation**: **Swagger/OpenAPI** was used to define the mock API.
-   **Diagrams/Images**: Placeholder images and conceptual diagrams are used to illustrate key points.
